2. Select the most recent successful build (indicated by a green checkmark)
3. Download the firmware package

## Flashing Process

### Left Half
1. Connect the left half of your keyboard to your computer via USB
2. Press the reset button twice quickly to enter bootloader mode
   - The keyboard will appear as a storage device in your file manager
3. Locate the firmware file beginning with "anywhy_flake_left..." (with `.uf2` extension)
4. Copy this file to the keyboard's storage device
   - The device will automatically disconnect once flashing is complete

### Right Half

2. Repeat the same process using the file beginning with "anywhy_flake_right..."

## Configuring with ZMK Studio

### Initial Connection
