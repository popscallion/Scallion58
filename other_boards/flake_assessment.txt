3. Component Technology (from .kicad_pcb & .kicad_sch)

Technology Mix: The design is a mix of Surface Mount (SMD) and Through-Hole (TH) components. MCUs (modules) and diodes are SMD. Switches use a hybrid footprint supporting TH pins and SMD hotswap sockets. Mounting holes are TH.

Diodes:

Reference Designators: D1 - D46.

Type: SMD (Diode_SMD:D_SOD-323_HandSoldering footprint).

Orientation: Placed adjacent to switches. Based on D13/SW13 example: Diode Anode (Pad 2) connects to Switch Pin 2. Diode Cathode (Pad 1) connects to the Row net.

Switch Identifiers:

Reference Designators: SW1 - SW46.

Footprint Name: axseem:SW_MX_Choc-v1v2_Hotswap.

Potential Relocations: Diodes are placed close to the switch footprints. Changing to a significantly different switch footprint (like Gateron KS-33 which has different pin positions than MX/Choc v1) would likely require relocating the diodes and rerouting associated traces.

Diode-Switch Connection: Switch Pin 2 connects to the Diode Anode (Pad 2). Switch Pin 1 connects to the Column Net. The Diode Cathode (Pad 1) connects to the Row Net.

4. Switch Footprint Analysis (from .kicad_pcb)

Current Footprint: axseem:SW_MX_Choc-v1v2_Hotswap (Supports Choc v1/v2 and MX switches with hotswap sockets).

Dimensions (approximate, based on pad coordinates relative to footprint center):

Through-Hole Pin Spacing (Pad 1 @ (-5, 3.75), Pad 2 @ (0, 5.95)): ~5.45mm apart.

Through-Hole Pad/Drill Size: 3.3mm pad, 3.0mm drill.

Hotswap Socket Pad Spacing (Pad 1 @ (-8.245, 3.75) / (-7.36, -2.54), Pad 2 @ (3.245, 5.95) / (6.09, -5.08)): Complex, designed for Kailh sockets.

Central Stem Hole: 4.9mm diameter drill.

Stabilizer Holes (oval): 2.12mm x 1.7mm drill.

Coordinates (Representative Switches):

SW1 (Top-Left area): (76 123.5)

SW13 (Example used): (76 161.5)

SW33 (Right side, inner thumb): (285 128.25)

SW46 (Bottom-Right area, angled): (225.17 181.94) @ 30 deg rotation.

Spacing: Center-to-center distance between adjacent switches appears to be 19.0 mm horizontally and vertically for the main alpha block, consistent with standard MX spacing (even though using Choc-compatible footprints). Thumb cluster spacing varies due to angles/positions.

5. Matrix Wiring Pattern (from .kicad_pcb & .kicad_sch)

Net Names:

Rows: LRow 0 to LRow 3 (Left), RRow 0 to RRow 3 (Right)

Columns: LCol 0 to LCol 5 (Left), RCol 0 to RCol 5 (Right)

Diode Role: Confirmed: Each switch connects a Column net (via Pin 1) to a Diode Anode (via Pin 2). The Diode Cathode connects to the corresponding Row net. This is a standard column-to-row configuration.

Trace Widths: Typical trace width observed for matrix connections appears to be 0.15 mm.

6. Available GPIO Analysis (from .kicad_sch & .kicad_pcb)

List Unused GPIO (Reiteration):

U1 (Left): Pin 1 (TX0/D3), Pin 11 (8/B4), Pin 16 (B1/15), Pin 17 (F7/A0), Pin 18 (F6/A1), Pin 19 (F5/A2), Pin 20 (F4/A3).

U2 (Right): Pin 1 (TX0/D3), Pin 5 (2/D1/SDA), Pin 6 (3/D0/SCL), Pin 7 (4/D4), Pin 8 (5/C6), Pin 9 (6/D7), Pin 14 (B2/16).

PCB Locations (Pad Coordinates relative to MCU center):

U1 (Center 189.64, 121.01): (-7.62, -12.7), (-7.62, 12.7), (7.62, 7.62), (7.62, 5.08), (7.62, 2.54), (7.62, 0), (7.62, -2.54).

U2 (Center 228.36, 121.01): (-7.62, -12.7), (-7.62, -2.54), (-7.62, 0), (-7.62, 2.54), (-7.62, 5.08), (-7.62, 7.62), (7.62, 12.7).

7. PCB Structure for Automation (from .kicad_pcb, .kicad_sch, .kicad_pro)

Project File Check (.kicad_pro): The provided .kicad_pro file is minimal and does not explicitly define project-specific libraries within its structure. Libraries seem to be referenced directly or are standard KiCad libraries.

Hierarchy: The schematic is hierarchical, using separate sheet files (left.kicad_sch, right.kicad_sch) instantiated in the root sheet.

Libraries in Use:

Footprints: axseem: (appears custom, used for ProMicro, Switches, Holes), Diode_SMD:, MountingHole: (likely standard or modified standard KiCad libraries).

Symbols: (Requires deeper schematic parsing, but likely includes standard Device, Connector, Switch symbols plus custom symbols for the ProMicro modules if not using a standard one).

Naming Conventions: Consistent use of prefixes (L/R for Left/Right), component types (SW, D, U, J, JP, H, RSW), and net types (Col, Row, Net-, unconnected-).

8. Physical Space for 5-Way Switch (from .kicad_pcb - Estimated)

Potential Locations (Estimated Coordinates):

Between MCUs: Approx. (209, 121) - Relatively open space between U1 and U2.

Inner Top Edge (Left): Approx. (170, 105) - Above the main key cluster, near the top edge.

Inner Top Edge (Right): Approx. (248, 105) - Mirrored position on the right side.

Clearances (Approximate):

Location 1: Close proximity to U1/U2 (~10mm) and inner column switches (~10-15mm).

Location 2/3: Clear space below, nearest components are top-row switches (~10-15mm away). Distance to board edge depends on final outline.

Proximity to GPIO:

Location 1 (Near 209, 121): Relatively close to inner pins of both U1 and U2. Unused pins like U1 Pad 16 (B1/15) at (197.26, 128.63) absolute, or U2 Pad 9 (6/D7) at (220.74, 128.63) absolute might be reachable.

Location 2/3 (Near 170/248, 105): Further from the main MCU pads. Routing might be more complex.

Automation Feasibility Assessment:

Switch Conversion (to KS-33): High complexity. The axseem:SW_MX_Choc-v1v2_Hotswap footprint is designed for MX/Choc v1 spacing and Kailh hotswap sockets. Gateron KS-33 switches have different pin positions and require different hotswap sockets (like Mill-Max 3305/7305 or specific Gateron sockets). This requires:

Replacing all SW\* footprints with a KS-33 compatible one.

Relocating all associated diodes (D\*).

Significant rerouting of row, column, and diode traces. This is challenging to automate reliably without sophisticated routing algorithms or manual intervention.

Adding 5-Way Switch: Moderate complexity.

Requires selecting a footprint for the 5-way switch.

Placing the footprint in an available space (requires geometric checks or manual placement).

Connecting the 5 switch pins + common pin (6 total) to available MCU GPIOs. Several unused GPIOs are available on both MCUs. Routing depends heavily on the chosen location and the proximity of unused GPIO pads/vias. Automation is feasible for netlist connection but placement and routing might need manual guidance or advanced scripting.
